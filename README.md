# What is GoGuardian?
GoGuardian is an educational technology company that provides software solutions specifically designed for K-12 schools. However, instead of helping the education experience they end up with idiots like me who are constantly trying to get around it. They say Their primary focus is on creating tools to help teachers and administrators manage and enhance students' digital learning experiences. Which I guess is a decent goal, but it can be annoying when I'm simply just trying to play Battlefield 2042 in my history class. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
